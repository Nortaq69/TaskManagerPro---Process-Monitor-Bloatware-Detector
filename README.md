## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Preferences File
The application saves user preferences in `preferences.json`:
```json
{
  "whitelist": ["chrome.exe", "firefox.exe"],
  "blacklist": ["malware.exe"],
  "auto_kill": false
}
```

### Log Files
- `process_monitor.log` - Main application logs
- `tray_monitor.log` - System tray monitor logs

## üîß Customization

### Adding Custom Bloatware Definitions
Edit the `BLOAT_PROCESSES` dictionary in the source files:

```python
"CustomProcess.exe": {
    "name": "Custom Process Name",
    "description": "Description of what this process does",
    "severity": "high",  # low, medium, high
    "category": "Custom Category"
}
```

### Whitelist Management
- Add processes to whitelist to exclude them from bloatware detection
- Use the Settings dialog or right-click menu
- Whitelisted processes are ignored by auto-kill

### Blacklist Management
- Add processes to blacklist for special attention
- Blacklisted processes can be targeted for manual termination

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Administrator Rights
- Process termination requires administrator privileges
- Some system processes cannot be terminated for security reasons
- The application will show appropriate error messages

### Safe Mode
- Always test in a safe environment first
- Some processes may be critical for system operation
- Use whitelist to exclude important processes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Access Denied" Errors
- Run the application as Administrator
- Some system processes cannot be terminated
- Check if the process is critical for system operation

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### GUI Not Displaying
- Ensure tkinter is installed: `python -m tkinter`
- Check display settings and resolution
- Try running in compatibility mode

#### System Tray Not Working
- Check if pystray is properly installed
- Ensure system tray is enabled in Windows
- Try running as Administrator

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust monitoring frequency in the code
- Use whitelist to reduce false positives
- Close unnecessary applications before monitoring
